# Advanced Sample Extension with OpenFeature for AL
[Advanced Sample Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extension-advanced-example) wrapped into a feature using [OpenFeature for AL](https://github.com/thetanz/OpenFeature-al)

[Diff between before and after branches](https://github.com/vody/CustomerRewardsFFExample/compare/before...after?diff=split) represents an additional effort required to wrap the extension into a feature.
